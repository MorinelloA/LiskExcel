### What is does

This simple application will allow you to gather all Lisk transactions that fit your criteria and enter them into an Excel Spreadsheet. These criteria include:

- Sender Address
- Recipient Address
- Sender OR Recipient Address
- Start Time
- End Time
- Trans Type (All, type 0, or type 3)
- Min Amount
- Max Amount
- Option to add links to the Explorer (For txs and addresses)

### Notes

- All three address fields may be left blank
- Start time must be earlier than End time
- Min Amount must be greater than or equal to Max Amount
- Entering a max value of 0 will effectively query all amounts from the Min entered upwards

### To Run

Simply navigate to the LiskExcel/bin/Release folder, and run LiskExcel.exe

### Future

If there is enough interest, I will convert this into a Web App for Lisk.support
